Hello World!
If you're reading this ... maybe don't.
Unless you're me, in which case maybe still don't.
The intention of this blog is to keep track of some of the things I learn as a software developer (and hopefully in doing so, commit them to memory more effectively).
Today I learnt, for example, that you can't really have destructors in java because the garbage collector - in theory - frees unused memory. Not so helpful when you want to add a function inside the destructor.
